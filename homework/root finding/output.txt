---------------------PART A---------------------
Finding roots of 1+(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2

The initial value is (x, y) = (4, 10)
The minimum should be at (x, y) = (a, b) = (6, 13)
The minimum is found at (x, y) = (6, 13),


Finding roots of the Rosenbrock valley function

The initial value is (x, y) = (0.5, 0.5)
The minimum is found at (x, y) = (1, 1)
